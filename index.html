		<p>About me: I'm 19 years old and from Costa Rica. I'm a freshman at Eugene Lang College, currently undeclared but probably majoring in Screen Studies.</p>

		<p>I have always found programming to be very interesting and took some introductory programming classes in high school. I am really looking forward to learning new things about this subject.</p>
